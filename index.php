<!--
don't do a whole lot - but what you do, do well - by design

build things and build my own stuff - build software
build something very well
simplicity and clarity
simple, small, focus, clarity simplicity

focus - take one small thing at a time - start small, make it smaller
scale it down and see what you can do - cut your ambitions in half
cut schedule / people / time / decisions  in half
version 1 should be cut in half - very few things you actually need

build things for yourself first - you know the problem, you'll find the solution

make things simple - do less
you don't compete by doing more
it's too easy - people will copy? - but they don't
they will complicate it
most people's problems are pretty simple
get the basics right - pay attention to them
most big companies don't make simple things for reasons
eg selling new versions/ adding new features .. etc
